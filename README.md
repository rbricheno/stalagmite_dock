## Stalagmite Dock for Madmax toolchanger

A dock for the [Madmax](https://github.com/zruncho3d/madmax) toolchanger system.

The same dock design supports both the [Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident) (2020) and the [Voron 0](https://vorondesign.com/voron0.2) (Makerbeam XL).

Flip the STL so you can have one on each side ðŸ™‚

Tested with DragonBrick. Other things might work.

Here it is on a Voron Trident:

Here is is on a ([Pandora gantry](https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandora)) Voron Zero:

# How to

The slots in the dock plates fit the FHCS from your Madmax toolheads.

Press some nice N52 magnets in to the back of the plate.

Mount to your verticals using M3 for the v0 version and M5 for the Trident version.

If using a two part design, you can use some 3mm dowels to align the plate to the spacer, and bolt those two parts together using a single M5 machine screw and bolt.

The two part design is because you might want to modify the spacing of the dock plates from the verticals, and this lets you play with that easily without constantly reprinting your plates.

The spacers in my STLs and the fusion file are correct for my Pandora gantry V0 and my normal-ish Trident 300.

# CAD details

Parametric design, following zruncho's ["Configurations Lite"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0W37SkbVsI) approach.

Change "Type" from 0 to 1 to switch from Trident to V0

Use the timeline to back out of the last merge if you want the plate to be separate from the spacer (probably only for the Trident).
